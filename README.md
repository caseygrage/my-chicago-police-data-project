Theme:
It is often explored whether certain identity groups of civilians face a greater percentage of police violence, or whether certain identity groups of officers face a greater percentage of allegations. But what are the most common pairings? Who is a black male officer most likely to receive allegations from? Who is mostly likely to assert police harassment against a Latina woman? We want to explore a number of these relationships. In other words, we aim to examine if there are trends in allegations/complaints between identity groups of civilians, identity groups of officers, and relationships between identity groups of officers and civilians. We are using “identity group” to indicate a group of people that have the same race and gender. We will also look at location of the allegation and age for certain inquiries.
