"23924","23924","1","1","""In the early evening of the day the Iraq War began in 2003, thousands of anti-war protesters gathered at Federal Plaza at Dearborn Avenue and Jackson Boulevard for a rally against the U.S.-led invasion. When the rally ended, the crowd of an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 people marched peacefully through downtown, chanting anti-war slogans and carrying signs and banners. Police escorted the demonstrators as they marched east to Lake Shore Drive and headed north. Officers briefly blocked the marchers at Michigan Avenue and Oak Street, then directed the crowd to head south. At Chicago Avenue, officers “herded and corralled” hundreds of the marchers just east of Michigan. About 800 people were detained for hours, forced to stand jam-packed together and surrounded by police, many of the officers wearing riot gear and carrying batons. Eventually, 200 to 250 of the protesters were allowed to leave, but only after police forced them to give up their anti-war signs, banners, flyers and pins. Over 500 people were arrested, handcuffed, searched and taken to police stations miles away—the men to the far South Side, the women to the West Side. Police held them for up to 40 hours in overcrowded and overheated cells and refused to give them food or allow them to make phone calls, receive medical treatment and have items for personal hygiene. Police records were falsified to cover up the neglect. Some of those arrested were not part of the demonstration, but were picked up as they walked to nearby hotels, got off buses or came from restaurants. Of those arrested, over 200 people were released without being charged and about 300 were charged with reckless conduct, a misdemeanor.""","JAROS","KRISTOPHE","M","WHITE"

Flood called 911, explained what was happening and the operator transferred him to Illinois State Police (ISP) because he was on the expressway at the time. An ISP employee told Flood to exit the expressway at Lawrence Avenue and drive to a police station. Flood exited the expressway, saw a parked Chicago police wagon parked on Logan Boulevard while on his way to the station and decided to pull up to it. Flood got out of the car and told the uniformed officers he was being chased by a violent man with a gun. Officer Carey then arrived on the scene and exited his vehicle with his handgun drawn.

The officers demanded to come inside, but when Negrete asked if they had a search warrant, they threw her onto the sofa and handcuffed her. Police searched both apartments in the building and found narcotics, then told Negrete she would be in trouble if she didn’t tell them “where to find the money.” They also threatened to take her children and told her she could “sign papers” and avoid being arrested. Negrete told them where to find money, but refused to sign any papers without an explanation or a lawyer. The officers then cursed at her and told her she’d be going to jail.

Thompson did not run, and an officer grabbed him by the belt and searched him. Another officer went into a gangway and returned some time later with a gun which did not belong to Thompson. Officers then pressured Thompson into identifying the house that the other people in the street had fled to. When he responded that he didn't know, Thompson was arrested and charged with aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. During their investigation, officers fabricated and withheld evidence in an attempt to falsely implicate Thompson in the crime. In October 2003, Thompson was convicted of the felony and sentenced to eight years in prison, based on false testimony offered by the officers. In December 2006, after he had served more than three years in prison, Thompson's conviction was vacated and the criminal charges against him were dismissed.""","SUCHOCKI","CARL","M","WHITE"

The complaints claimed that on multiple occasions a confidential informant had purchased drugs from the two dealers at the home. Cooper, a 32-year-old decorated police officer, was at the residence with his two minor sons, his wife and his mother when officers forcibly entered the home looking for the two cocaine dealers. Assuming the home was being burglarized, Cooper drew his gun. In response, the officers also drew their guns. Cooper presented the officers with his badge and deed to the building, which he had owned for the past four years. Upon realizing that the warrant had the wrong home and that Cooper was a police officer, the officers decided to execute the search anyway. For 75 minutes, the officers forced the family to stay in one area of the home while the officers and two dogs searched all floors, including an unfinished basement. The officers left after finding no drugs or anyone living in the basement. The officers made reports stating that the Coopers had informed them that one of the cocaine dealers had previously lived in that residence.

Abbate stepped behind the bar and attacked Obrycka, beating, kicking and punching her. Ababte left, and the police were called to the bar. The manager of the bar, Kolodziej, and a patron, Cepiaszuk, informed officers that Officer Abbate was a Chicago Police officer and that the assault had been recorded on video. A friend of Abbate’s who worked at Jesse’s told him about the tape. Abbate and his friend told Obrycka that if she declined to file a complaint, Abbate in exchange would pay for her medical bills, lost wages and other financial losses because of the beating. Obrycka refused. Abbate and other defendants then turned to threats, telling Obrycka, her manager, and the owner of Jesse’s that if they didn’t turn the videotape over to them or destroy it without showing it to anyone else, their lives--and the lives of other employees and even patrons of Jesse’s--would be in danger and they would be arrested on various trumped-up charges. Obrycka and her manager went to the police department’s Office of Professional Standards, but soon realized that the office was not properly investigating the attack. Representatives for Obrycka and the other plaintiffs gave the videotape of the beating to the media. Abbate was indicted in April 2007 on 14 counts of aggravated battery, official misconduct and conspiracy. Abbate was found guilty of aggravated battery, but acquitted of official misconduct, and sentenced to two years probation.""","ABBATE","ANTHONY","M","WHITE"

They entered Nava’s bedroom with their guns drawn and ordered Nava to get on the floor, where they began to kick and stomp on his head. The officers handcuffed him so tightly that the handcuffs cut into his wrists, causing him to lose feeling in them. Nava complained to the officers, who told him that the handcuffs were not meant for comfort. Detectives Salemme and Schober approached Nava and began punching him with a closed first in the stomach, ribs and kidneys for about 30 minutes while making sarcastic remarks. Nava began screaming and demanding his lawyer. All the while, Nava was bleeding from his mouth, nose and inner jaw wall. Nava was taken to the Area 4 Police Headquarters and placed in a locked room. Detectives Munoz and BOR came into the room to question him. While one asked the questions, the other detective punched Nava in the mouth, ribs or chest when he asked for a lawyer or didn’t answer a question. After the assault, which lasted for about an hour, Nava was taken into another room with no chairs or benches. He was forced to sit on the cold floor, bleeding from his face. Nava requested medical assistance several times, but was denied. After eight hours, when Nava was allowed to use the bathroom, he noticed blood in his urine. As a result, he was taken to the hospital where he was treated for internal bleeding.""","SCHOBER","WILLIAM","M","WHITE"

When they arrived at the courthouse, the guards learned that his hearing had been moved to a different date. As the guards were headed back to Dixon with McCormick, they were stopped by Detectives Loftus and Shebish. The detectives asked the guards to take McCormick to a police station so they could use him in a lineup. The guards initially said no because a court order only allowed them to take McCormick to and from the courthouse. The detectives then spoke to the guards in private and convinced them to take McCormick to the police lineup. During the drive to the station, the guards lied to McCormick, saying they'd talked to the warden in Dixon and gotten permission to let the detectives use him for their lineup. Once at the station, McCormick pleaded with the guards to not to leave him with the detectives because he feared they'd hurt him. He also asked for a lawyer, but was denied. He was later moved to another station and, while being relocated, an unknown police officer hit him in the back. At the second station, McCormick was stripped naked and put in a cold cell by other police officers. McCormick later agreed to be fingerprinted and photographed so he could get his clothes back.""","LOFTUS","PATRICK","M","WHITE"

The following day officers arrested Wilson, an African-American man, at the same bus stop. Over the course of 30 hours police verbally threatened and physically attacked Wilson to coerce him into signing a false confession. Officers also denied Wilson sleep, food and his blood pressure medication in order to coerce him into saying he attacked Siler. Fearing for his life Wilson signed a statement written by Officer Healy. Officers Rolston and McInerney then manipulated Siler into identifying Wilson as her attacker. Meanwhile, in the two weeks following the attack on Siler, Wagner attacked five additional women. These other five attacks all happened within a one and a half mile radius of the attack on Siler and involved women Wagner thought were White who he stabbed on the street. Wagner was arrested on March 15, 1997 wearing a pair of black Velcro shoes matching the ones Siler told police her attacker was wearing when she was attacked. Det. Triggs charged Wagner with the five other attacks, but not Siler's. At no point did officers speak to Siler about Wagner's arrest or ask Wagner if he attacked Siler.

Chraca was hospitalized and admitted to have been drinking and using marijuana and cocaine that evening. Bryniarski had also been drinking. Bryniarski admitted to officers that he had not seen the shooter and that he would have a difficult time identifying him. Chraca told officers that he also had not seen the shooter, but that he believed him to be a white male in his 20s. The investigation was suspended for lack of leads, but renewed a month later when officers executed a search warrant of Jakub Rozanski, who attempted to flee with a gun. Rozanski, 22, was arrested with Crawford, 24, and Parker, 26—all white males. Officers found that Rozanski’s gun was the same gun used in the shooting of Chraca. In a line-up, Chraca and Bryniarski identified Crawford as someone resembling the shooter. The investigator in the case requested to interview Crawford and Rozanski where Rozanski was told that the gun he had been arrested with had been used in a shooting. Rozanski denied that Crawford was the shooter and instead named Galindo. He said that Galindo had been a passenger in the car with him and Crawfod. He had only been holding on to the gun at Galindo’s request. A search warrant for Galindo’s home was obtained with claims that drugs would be found. No drugs were found.

Detectives Madigan and McWeeny questioned Andrews about gunshots at a dog fight and asked if he knew two men—murder victims whose deaths the officers were investigating. Shortly after, the detectives accused Andrews of murdering the men. According to police reports, Burge, a lieutenant and commanding officer of a violent crimes unit, had coordinated and supervised the investigation of the murders, including Andrews’ arrest. Every time he was questioned, Andrews denied any involvement. As a result, the officers physically and verbally abused Andrews. He was denied his Miranda rights, access to an attorney, a phone call and food. Andrews was beaten with a heavy-duty police-issue flashlight and endured continuous fist punches. Madigan attempted to coach Andrews about the details of the murder, telling him what he was to say in a statement to the State’s Attorney’s Office. During the session, Madigan repeatedly struck Andrews with the flashlight and his fists. After eight hours of interrogation and torture, Andrews confessed to murdering one of the two victims, reciting the story that was given to him.

Although the officers found no contraband inside, they arrested Blackwell and seized the car. At the police station, officers showed Blackwell bags of a controlled substance. Blackwell protested that he did not have drugs on him, and the officers replied, “You do now.” Blackwell was booked and charged with felony drugs charges and traffic charges. He was incarcerated for two months. Ford never received her car or the personal property that had been inside the car at the time of Blackwell’s arrest. The charges against Blackwell were dismissed.""","RYSZKA","PAWEL","M","WHITE"

Despite performing the Standardized Field Performance Test, and knowing that they were not driving under the influence, Officer Fiorito charged them with false DUI charges. The officer created false reports and provided false testimony in court. The arrest of Dean and Lopez were part of a series of other improper arrests by Officer Fiorito, done with the purpose of accumulating overtime pay for court appearances. Officer Fiorito is a midnight officer and is paid overtime for every court appearance that is not scheduled during his regular shift. Because all court appearances never occurred while he was on overnight duty, Officer Fiorito was guaranteed overtime pay. Due to the high volume of his cases, the City added “key dates” to his court schedule, happening once a month where the bulk of his cases would be scheduled on those days. However, Fiorito was present in court nearly every day. All of his police reports were similar in content, always claiming that every driver in every DUI arrest would “fail to stay in lanes,” “swerve, speed, drive without headlights,” “almost strike parked cars,” and “fail to wear seatbelts.” Officer Fiorito did this for several years until 2009 when a representative of the Cook County State’s Attorney said that Officer Fiorito’s credibility was being questioned, and therefore, he could no longer be used as witness for the prosecution.

"11976","11976","95","95","""On Nov. 19, 1994, a 15-year-old girl walking on the street was raped on the city's South Side. The victim was white and only knew her attacker was African-American and that he'd warned her not to open her eyes or she'd be killed. She also contracted multiple sexually transmitted diseases from the rape. Based on an anonymoust tip, officers brought the victim to Ben's Meat Market, where Cage worked, and she identified him as her attacker. At the time of the rape, Cage was at home with his fiance and, once in police custody, he could prove he had no sexually transmitted diseases. Officers charged Cage with the 15-year-old's rape anyway, and his bond was set at half a million dollars, which Cage's family was unable to pay. Officers also tried to link a second, unrelated rape of a 29-year-old African-American woman to the Cage, but Cage was later acquitted of this other woman's rape thanks to DNA evidence. Instead of trying to find the victim's actual attacker, officers then decided to portray Cage as a serial rapist and tie him to a string of at least eight other rapes alongside the one involving the 15-year-old girl. To this end, officers fabricated evidence, manipulated witnesses, destroyed police reports and obscured the fact that Cage's DNA and fingerprints were never found at the crime scene where the 15-year-old girl was raped. In 1996, Cage was convicted of three counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault and sentenced to 20 years in prison. While incarcerated, Cage pleaded with the courts to permit DNA testing on the biological material recovered from the 15-year-old victim's rape, even offering to pay for the testing himself.

"20858","20858","100","100","""Wright was arrested multiple times in 2008 and 2009 for offenses that, under the law, only merited a ticket and a fine. The first arrest took place in July 2008, when Officers Perez and Mook issued Wright a ticket for excessive noise as he sat in his parked car. Perez then threw Wright against the car and handcuffed him. The two officers took Wright to the 24th District police station, but refused to let him call his lawyer, give him his medication for high blood pressure and back pain, let him see a doctor or give him any food, water or access to the bathroom. The next day, officers took Wright to Cook County Jail, but authorities there refused to jail him because the arrest stemmed from a ticket, not a crime. Back at the 24th District station, a supervisor ordered officers to release Wright. Several months later, the ticket was dismissed and the City of Chicago was ordered to pay Wright back for the costs he incurred from towing and storage of his car after the arrest. Wright later filed a civil rights suit against Perez and Mook. About a year later, in June 2009, Wright was again ticketed for playing his music too loud--this time by two officers, Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz, who worked the same shift as Perez and Mook. Vanourek and Pietrusiewicz again arrested Wright, took him to the police station and impounded and searched his car. This time, Wright was released the same day; the following month, the city dismissed the ticket. Later on the same day the ticket was dismissed, Wright was driving west on Rogers Avenue near Clark Street, when Vanourek and Officer Cerkic made a U-turn, stopped him in a private parking lot on Clark, cited him again for excessive noise--even though the radio in his car wasn’t working--and arrested him. Vanourek shoved Wright into the squad car, hitting Wright’s head on the car. Wright was charged with resisting arrest and spent three days in jail, but was later found not guilty of the charges. In August 2009, Wright was stopped by police once again, this time for allegedly driving his car over the divider line on North Clark. Sgt. Baranowski searched Wright and arrested him for allegedly having a small baggy of marijuana in his front pocket. The case was later dismissed.""","BARANOWSKI","JOHN","M","WHITE"

"7894","7894","323","323","""In July 1988, two women and three children were killed when someone set fire to their home. The following month, a convicted felon serving time in a downstate prison called detectives and promised information about the murders in exchange for a transfer to a work-release program. He told the detectives that Reeves and another man had separately called him and confessed to the murders, which was not true. The detectives and an assistant state's attorney had the informant call the two men at least 36 times to try to get them to admit to the crime, but neither did so. Nevertheless, officers arrested one of the men and brought him to a police station, where they beat him with a blackjack, telephone and telephone book and kicked and punched him repeatedly over several hours. Eventually, the man gave a false confession, implicating himself and Reeves in the murders. Reeves was arrested in August 1988, and the two men were charged with the murders. They were both convicted. In 1995, their convictions were vacated, but they were re-tried and re-convicted in 1997, again based almost entirely on the informant’s false testimony. In 2009, after evidence of the practice of torture by the """"midnight crew"""" led by Cmdr. Burge and the other defendant officers had been uncovered, Reeves was exonerated and released from prison after 21 years.""","PALADINO","JOHN","M","WHITE"

The officer shoved Malandrucco and glared at him; Malandrucco told the officer he was putting on his coat and that he would get out of his way shortly. Clark and Malandrucco left the restaurant to go to the parking lot, where they encountered the same three officers, who began to yell at them. Clark and Malandrucco attempted to defuse the situation by offering to shake hands and make peace, and by suggesting that everyone go home since nothing had happened. Suddenly and without warning, the plainclothes officer punched Clark and began to repeatedly strike him, throwing him to the ground. Clark did not fight back, but tried to protect himself. Malandrucco attempted to protect Clark, but the officers responded by beating him and throwing him to the ground, where he hit his head against the concrete, knocking him unconscious.

Hughes told his fellow officers to stand back, then tased Gonzalez for an excessive amount of time. Hughes shocked Gonzalez at least one more time after that. Then the officers beat Gonzalez and placed him in a hog-tied position -- his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs shackled. Throughout the incident, Gonzalez displayed obvious signs of distress and difficulty breathing. He was overweight, intoxicated and possibly high on cocaine. One of the officers pepper-sprayed Gonzalez in the face, brought him to the squad car and finally dropped him on the side of the car. They placed him in the squad car in the same hog-tied position. Gonzalez was eventually taken to the hospital, where he died later that night.

The relative was jumped by a group of attackers outside the store, and a fight broke out. As the relative ran back toward the house, Officer Haleem ran after him and shoved a baseball bat between the front door and the door frame to keep the family from closing it. Annette Wright, V.U.’s mother, grabbed the bat and tried to push it away, but eventually let go of it. Officer Haleem then ran into the home and hit V.U. in the head with the bat, knocking him off his chair. Haleem then threw V.U. outside through a window. V.U. was taken to the police station, to Holy Cross Hospital for treatment, back to the station and then to the Juvenile Detention Center at 39th Street and California Avenue.

The following month, a convicted felon serving time in a downstate prison called detectives and promised information about the murders in exchange for a transfer to a work-release program. He told the detectives that Reeves and another man had separately called him and confessed to the murders, which was not true. The detectives and an assistant state's attorney had the informant call the two men at least 36 times to try to get them to admit to the crime, but neither did so. Nevertheless, officers arrested one of the men and brought him to a police station, where they beat him with a blackjack, telephone and telephone book and kicked and punched him repeatedly over several hours. Eventually, the man gave a false confession, implicating himself and Reeves in the murders. Reeves was arrested in August 1988, and the two men were charged with the murders. They were both convicted. In 1995, their convictions were vacated, but they were re-tried and re-convicted in 1997, again based almost entirely on the informant’s false testimony. In 2009, after evidence of the practice of torture by the """"midnight crew"""" led by Cmdr. Burge and the other defendant officers had been uncovered, Reeves was exonerated and released from prison after 21 years.""","MASLANKA","ANTHONY","M","WHITE"

When Van Kuiken banged on the hood and asked why the driver didn’t stop, Officer Davis jumped out of the car and said to him, “You’re messing with the wrong motherf****r!” An argument started between the men. Officer Davis, who didn’t identify himself as a police officer, drew his gun, pointed it at Mackey and then pushed it in Van Kuiken’s chest and threatened to kill him. Family members who were with Van Kuiken and Mackey called the police, and Officer Davis told them “Good. You’re the ones that are going to jail. I’m a f**king cop!” To cover up his misconduct, Officer Davis gave misleading information to officers who responded to the 911 call. Both Mackey and Van Kuiken asked to press charges and give statements. After three hours at the police station, the men went to a nearby store to buy food.

He told the detectives that Reeves and another man had separately called him and confessed to the murders, which was not true. The detectives and an assistant state's attorney had the informant call the two men at least 36 times to try to get them to admit to the crime, but neither did so. Nevertheless, officers arrested one of the men and brought him to a police station, where they beat him with a blackjack, telephone and telephone book and kicked and punched him repeatedly over several hours. Eventually, the man gave a false confession, implicating himself and Reeves in the murders. Reeves was arrested in August 1988, and the two men were charged with the murders. They were both convicted. In 1995, their convictions were vacated, but they were re-tried and re-convicted in 1997, again based almost entirely on the informant’s false testimony.

Without justification or warning, Amador reached through Pugh's window and hit him in the face with his gun. At the same time, other officers dragged Pugh's friend out of the car and beat him. The only reason officers did not beat Pugh was because he pleaded with them not to aggravate his disability. Amador accused Pugh of being a drug dealer. Officers handcuffed Pugh and his friend and searched his car. Amador claimed to find a tin foil packet with less than 0.1 grams of heroin. Officers took Pugh and his friend to the Homan Square facility, where he was interrogated without being read his rights. Officers later brought the two back to the McDonald's, bought them dinner, then took them to a police station, where they were finally processed.

The warrant was for the first-floor apartment where Robison and Walker lived. Walker had recently rented the apartment from Burns, the building owner, who lived on the second floor.

By that time, around 2:30 p.m., school was dismissed and children who were leaving gathered around Dunn and Contreras. Dunn roughly grabbed Contreras, who is 70 years old and approximately 5 feet tall, threw her against a police car, shoved her lefs apart and conducted an aggressive search. A schoolgirl was taking pictures of the incident, and Officer Dunn told her to mind her own business. When she continued to take pictures, Dunn grabbed the girl and smashed her face against the side of the police car. Dunn then drove the car with Contreras in it one block west to Whipple Street, stopped the car, and wrote Contreras a ticket concerning the operation of her push cart. Then she opened the back door, grabbed Contreras’ apron and began choking her with it, yelling “You are going to die.” Dunn pulled Contreras from the squad car and threw into the street, threw the tickets, her state ID and her permit on her, then drove away. A bystander called 9-1-1, and an ambulance came and took Contreras to Holy Cross Hospital.

While Grayer was handcuffed on the ground with his pants pulled down, Cerda fired the Taser gun onto his bare buttocks, while laughing and joking with the other officers. Then Cerda pushed the Taser barb into Grayer’s buttocks with his boot while Grayer was still handcuffed and on the ground. Grayer was taken to the hospital to remove the Taser barb. Delaney, Corona and Cerda falsified police reports and filed false charges against Grayer. He was later found not guilty of all of these charges.""","ZAMBRANO","JAVIER","M","WHITE HISPANIC"

One of the passengers was caught. Cherry was a known associate of one of the passengers, and police detained and interrogated Cherry to ask questions about the hit-and-run homicide, of which he knew nothing. Two months later, Cherry was falsely arrested as an accomplice to an unrelated armed robbery. When taken in for questioning to the CPD Precinct, officers and two prosecutors interrogated Cherry about the hit-and-run case, not the armed robbery for which he had just been arrested. Still unable to provide them with information, he was taken into a lineup, and later told that he was identified by the victims of the robbery. The officers then asked Cherry if there was anything he would like to tell them now that he had been “identified.” Still unable to tell the officers anything, Cherry was charged with armed robbery, burglary, unlawful restraint and unlawful use of a weapon by a felon and was held in the Cook County Department of Corrections until he posted bail a year later. As Cherry awaited trial, the state continued to use the armed robbery charge as a bargaining chip to pressure him into testifying about the homicide.

Officer Funchion ignored this and continued his inspection while repeatedly asking Izsak how he could afford the yacht in front of his guests. During the inspection, Officer Funchion asked Izsak if he had anything illegal on The Flying Lady. Izsak said he did not, but Officer Funchion claimed that he knew there was something illegal and he was going to find it. He ransacked the yacht's bedroom, drawers and cabinets without justification. When nothing illegal was found, Officer Funchion falsely claimed Vosatka spit on him in order to threaten to impound the boat and arrest them. He then grabbed Vosatka, 68, and handcuffed him. Officers roughly moved Vosatka on to the police boat. They searced his pockets and took his car keys and a cell phone case, which were never returned. Vosatka, who had a medical condition that made it difficult to sit for long periods of time, tried to stand up, but officers pushed him back down, breaking his glasses. Vosatka refused to sign a ticket for an ordinance violation, so officers took him to a police station and charged with reckless conduct. After approximately four court appearances, the charge was dismissed.""","THOMAS","ARAMON","M","BLACK"

In the alley, the group noticed a police vehicle without its lights on speeding in their direction. The group jumped out of the way of the speeding car. The squad car came to a quick halt and two officers, including Officer Bond, got out. Bond drew his gun and aimed it at all three of the boys. The officers yanked A.M. from his bike and placed him near G.B. and J.A.. Bond yelled at the boys, “Why were you in my f**king yard?” The boys informed him that they had not been playing in Bond’s yard, but in A.M.’s backyard. One of the officers pushed the boys to the ground and handcuffed them. All three began to complain about the treatment, especially J.A., who was told to stop speaking or Bond would bang his head against the garage. Some time later, the officers took the handcuffs off and allowed the three boys to leave.""","BOND","LAWRENCE","M","WHITE"

In one instance, Officer Campbell eavesdropped on a phone conversation Figueroa was having with Kimble-Figueroa about their children. During the call, Officer Campbell grabbed the phone from Kimble-Figueroa, identified himself as a Chicago police officer, and threatened Figueroa with arrest if he didn't fully cooperate with her during the divorce. The following day, Figueroa went to his wife's home to drop off his children. Officer Campbell was standing with other unknown officers in full uniform, blocking Figueroa's path to the building's entrance. Officer Campbell told Figueroa he'd been called to supervise the transfer of the children. This was a lie, because there was no complaint or court order asking Officer Campbell to be there.

They accused him of committing a crime and forced Codgell back to the turnstiles at the station. Earlier, when Codgell was with his co-worker, a man asked if he could pass through on the co-worker's Ventra card. Codgell, who wasn't taking the train, swiped his Ventra card for the man instead, declined to take any money from him, and started walking home. The officers told Codgell it was illegal to accept money in exchange for the use of a Ventra card or to give away a transfer fare. Codgell denied he took any money from the man, showed the officers that he didn't have any cash and presented his Ventra card and identification.

Pierce complied. The officers asked him if he had anything in his pockets that he should not have and then searched him -- even though they had no reason to believe he was carrying anything illegal. The officers found nothing illegal on Pierce; still, they handcuffed him, put him in their squad car and searched the moped. No weapons, drugs or other contraband were found. The officers took Pierce to a police station, where he was denied an opportunity to call to have his moped retrieved. Officer Appel completed a report stating that the moped would be impounded while Pierce was held at the police station awaiting questioning by a detective. Witnesses later told Pierce’s girlfriend that two officers had pushed the moped into an alley. Family members found the moped completely destroyed with a tow number attached, indicating that it would be picked up and sold as scrap metal.

During the search of Sperling's vehicle, Pruente found a bag containing illegal drugs and filed felony drug charges against Sperling. At a criminal hearing, Officers Morgan and Pruente and Sgt.

Two male officers arrived later, and one of them called him a """"spic."""" Though nothing illegal was uncovered, the officers issued Guzman a false citation for driving without headlights. In January 2014, Officer Emily Campbell pulled Guzman over near South Narragansett Avenue and 56th Street, searched him, and released him after nothing illegal was found.

Police asked Santiago to meet them at a gas station, where they arrested her and took her to a police station for questioning without reading her Miranda rights. Santiago asked for an attorney, but the detectives ignored her request.

Webster was incarcerated in Cook County Jail for 30 days. Eventually, the charges against him were dismissed.""","RUBALD","ZACHARY","M","WHITE"

Officer Delgado gave him the finger and then pulled up beside him and said, “Nigger, why you cut me off? I’ll have your black ass arrested.” Henry responded, saying, “F**k you, I know policemen, too.” Officer Delgado and his girlfriend then went to a police station, where Delgado identified himself as a police officer and falsely claimed that Henry had impersonated an officer during their interaction. Henry was arrested and charged with impersonating a police officer, and was incarcerated at Cook County Jail for three months, before he was found not guilty at a jury trial.

Green pointed to the sticker on the windshield and raised her voice at London as she and Fisher continued onto Vincennes Avenue. London followed and called 911 to report she was in distress. Near West 100th Place and South Vincennes Avenue, a group of officers, including London and Officer Williams, pulled over Green, Fisher and Jones.

The officers took Fisher’s identification, and Green missed her sister’s burial. The officers returned to a police station and falsified reports claiming Green had hit London with a bottle. Meanwhile, when Fisher went to the same station to retrieve his identification, London and others placed him in handcuffs and locked him up until the next day. Green called the Independent Police Review Authority to report the incident, and an investigator told Green he would obtain the Police Observation Device camera recordings of the incident. The police did not provide the recordings before the trial. Under oath, London stated that Green threw a bottle at her and hit her in the face. The charges against Fisher and Jones were dropped, but the judge found Green guilty of battery. After Green was convicted, the police released the camera recordings. The recordings showed that the charges against Green were false and London had lied on the witness stand.

Sergeant Schield arrived, walked over to the crowd and told them to “Get the f**k off the corner.”
 Smith began walking away when Schield yelled at him, “Nigger you think I’m playing, I’ll lock your ass up.” Smith stopped, turned and looked at the officer, and then continued walking. Schield once again yelled at Smith, “You think I’m playing?” and told three police officers to “put the cuffs on.” Without any warning, the officers grabbed Smith from behind and slammed him onto the hood of a squad car. Smith felt pain in his chest and torso. One of the officers bent Smith’s arms behind his back and put him in handcuffs that were too tight, cutting off Smith’s circulation. Schield then said, “Since he wants to be around crime scenes, put him in my car and let him get a good view.” 
The officers pulled Smith into the sergeant's car. When Smith asked the officers to slow down because he has a heart condition and he might fall, one of the officers replied, “Suck my dick.” Smith was held in Schield’s car for about 40 minutes until the arrival of Commander Fletcher, who spoke to Schield and released Smith.

Shortly after van der Vant moved into her home, she decided to erect a fence around the perimeter of her property. When the officers who live around her learned of her plans they complained and protested. The plaintiff put up her fence anyway, and since then the officers have harassed her. The harassment has included officers putting empty ticket envelopes on van der Vant’s vehicle when it was parked outside her home and issuing complaints and threats over her barking dog. In one instance, Officer Hallinan got a call from an unknown officer who lived on van der Vant’s block complaining about her dog. Hallinan and Officers Aviles and Davis headed to the plaintiff's home and entered her fenced-off yard without permission to remove the collar from her dog's neck. Soon after, the plaintiff called her dog into her home and noticed the collar was missing. The next day she filed a police report for the missing collar. Hallinan called the plaintiff's husband later that day to say the collar had been recovered and was ready to be picked up at the Jefferson Park police station. It was urgent that it be picked up or the collar would not be available for several weeks, Hallinan said. Van der Vant’s husband called her and asked her to pick up the collar on her way home from work. When the plaintiff arrived at the station she asked for Hallinan, who requested her identification. After she presented her identification, officers surrounded the plaintiff and arrested her without justification on suspicion of animal abuse. Three veterinarians examined the plaintiff's dog after her arrest and concluded the dog was in good health. While she was in police custody and handcuffed for hours to a steel bench, van der Vant’s sciatica flared up, requiring hospitalization. The charges against van der Vant were later dismissed during a bench trial.""","AVILES","IVAN","M","WHITE HISPANIC"

Still, Nash told people in the neighborhood that two police officers had robbed him.
 A few months later, three masked men robbed and fatally shot a man named Leon Stroud in his home. There were two witnesses to the incident, one inside and one outside the home. Both witnesses said they saw three men enter the home and shoot Stroud, and one of the witnesses identified Alvin Wyatt as one of the three masked men. The police questioned Wyatt, who denied any involvement in the incident. Investigators interviewed Wyatt again and used verbal and physical force to make him say he was in Stroud’s home and met only one other man there. The investigators told Wyatt he would not be charged or go to jail if he agreed to tell this story. Wyatt agreed, and Officers Solecki and Baker, who are Area 2 police officers, arrested Nash despite proof that he had been shopping the day of the incident. Solecki and Baker then put Nash in a suggestive lineup. One of the witnesses identified Nash as one of the masked men. The witness, however, had known Nash for years and had not named him earlier. Solecki and Baker hid evidence proving Nash’s innocence from prosecutors, and failed to disclose the fact that both witnesses saw three masked men leave the home, rather than two. Despite no physical evidence connecting Nash to the crime, Nash was convicted of murder. He spent the next 17 years in prison. In October 2007, Nash filed a motion to seek DNA testing on the mask found at the crime scene. Three years later, a test revealed that Nash did not match either of the DNA profiles found on the mask.

The officers shackled one of Douglas’ wrists to a window bar on the home, pulled his pants down to his ankles, bent him over and searched his buttocks. When the officers realized a neighbor was watching, they put Douglas into the back of the squad car with Ford, put Halley back in Douglas’ car and relocated to an alley behind a church. There, Officer Wherfel ordered Halley, who was surrounded by five male officers, to get out of the car and remove her pants. Halley pleaded with Wherfel, explaining that she was menstruating and was using a tampon. Wherfel uncuffed one of Halley’s hands and ordered her to remove the tampon. She tearfully removed the tampon, and Wherfel used her fingers to probe Halley’s vagina while the male officers looked on, commenting on Halley’s body.

Instead officers arrested Slater and he spent two years in Cook County Jail awaiting his trial. The charges against him were dismissed at a jury trial.""","SOTO","RICARDO","M","WHITE HISPANIC"

Mitchell ran, and Palomino pulled out a gun and ran after him. De La Torre also followed on foot. Soon other officers arrived and pursued Mitchell. He was pushed to the ground, and Officer Gunning handcuffed Mitchell’s hands behind his back. De La Torre walked up to Mitchell, called him a “B***h” and kicked Mitchell in the head several times. De La Torre threatened to use a Taser on Mitchell if he did not get up, and dragged Mitchell by his wrists across the pavement. Mitchell was taken to a police station and placed in a holding cell. 
At the station, De La Torre threatened to come into Mitchell’s cell and “whoop his ass.” He then asked Mitchell if he had any keys on him, and Mitchell handed over his car keys. Mitchell was then taken to a hospital, where he received 14 stitches for deep cuts on his shoulders and face. When Mitchell was taken back to the station, he learned the officers were claiming that they had stopped Mitchell while he was driving and found a weapon in his car. The officers falsely charged Mitchell with driving on a suspended license and failure to stop at a stop sign. Knowing that Mitchell had prior arrests and was on probation, the officers also charged him with resisting arrest, felony possession of a firearm as a prior felon and felony possession of a firearm while on parole.

After trying to remove the key, Barron climbed onto a dumpster to see if he could gain access to his back patio door, which is attached to his garage roof. After determining it would be too dangerous, Barron returned to the main entrance and spoke with a neighbor, who provided some hand tools to try and remove the broken key from the lock. Several minutes later, Officer Moy approached the two men and aggressively told Barron to stay off the garage roof. When Barron explained he was locked out of his home, Moy responded with profanity, said he had called the police and drove away. Barron’s neighbor explained that Moy was a police officer who lived nearby. Soon after, two police officers arrived in a Chicago Police Department SUV and said they had been called about a man on a roof. Barron explained the situation. “Cool,” one of the officers replied, and without exiting their vehicle, the officers drove away. Barron’s neighbor left, and Barron decided to climb onto the roof. Once there, he heard a voice screaming, “Get on the f**king ground.” It was Moy, standing on the back porch of a nearby residence, pointing a handgun at Barron. He told Barron he was under arrest and threatened to shoot him if he did not get on the ground. Barron obeyed, and Moy held him at gunpoint for 15 minutes while waiting for other officers to arrive. Once the officers came, Moy lied and told them Barron climbed over his fence into his backyard, screamed incoherently on Moy’s back porch, banged on Moy’s back door and threatened him with an AIDS needle. Barron was falsely charged and arrested with criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. The charges were dropped one year later.""","MOY","JONATHAN","M","ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER"

Smith suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and was diagnosed as 100 percent disabled. Smith was with a friend at a laundromat when he stepped outside and a man handed Smith a beer. Officer Manning and his partner drove up to Smith in an unmarked car and got out. Manning placed his hand on his gun. Fearing for his safety, Smith ran from the officers, and Manning called on the radio for additional officers to pursue Smith for drinking on a public way.

When Moore objected to the search, Boyle responded, “If you don’t like it, do something about it.” Moore was released when the officers found no weapons. On a separate occasion, Moore was stopped without probable cause while driving near South Pulaski Road and 5th Avenue. This time, after Moore pulled over to the curb, a police car swerved in front of his SUV and officers surrounded the car with guns drawn. Moore had a passenger in the car and the police aimed their guns at Moore and his passenger. Sergeant Griffin said, “Don’t reach or I’ll shoot.” Moore was ordered out of his car and was searched. When he asked why he was stopped, Boyle said, “Shut the f**k up!” Moore was then handcuffed and his socks and shoes were taken. Boyle asked Moore, “Do you remember me?” Boyle and Officer Velez then searched Moore’s car without his consent.

While the women waited, a man who was bleeding from a gunshot wound in his leg ran up to them. Officers Chapman and Collier approached the group and began shooting. The man moved to block the women from the gunfire, taking several bullets in the chest. A bullet fired by the officers also hit a 13-year-old bystander.

After initially maintaining his innocence, Hill eventually gave in and falsely admitted to assaulting and murdering the woman. 
Hill’s confession also implicated two other men.

The officers used physical force to make the two men confess, including beating one with a blackjack and putting a pistol in his mouth. 
The officers released one of the men Hill had implicated but used false information and destroyed evidence to prosecute Hill and the other man.

 Walker asked Aguero if he had any traffic tickets, and Aguero said he did. Walker asked Aguero how he knew the plates had been stolen, and Aguero explained that the screws had been removed and his plates were gone. Walker replied, “You know you ain’t getting out of paying for your tickets.” Aguero said that was not his intention. Walker repeated that Aguero needed to pay his tickets, and that he was not fooled by Aguero’s “Latin King gang banging bulls**t.” Aguero is not a member of the Latin King gang.
 Aguero asked for Walker’s badge number, and Walker refused to provide it. Aguero then asked Walker and Schanelli if they were going to help him retrieve his stolen plates, and they replied no. As Aguero exited the station, Walker followed him and approached Aguero’s car. Walker then ordered Schanelli and an unnamed officer to arrest Aguero.

The officers handcuffed Keys’ hands behind his back using a plastic restraint. Then they walked him to a nearby Chicago Housing Authority complex, where police were conducting a mission to arrest individuals suspected of drug activity. 
The officers put Keys on a nearby curb, where he sat with several other handcuffed individuals for about 15 minutes. The officers then told Keys he was free to go as soon as they found a device—commonly referred to as a “cutter”—to safely remove the plastic restraint. One of the officers tried to remove Keys’ restraint with a knife, but was unsuccessful. Two other officers tried using knives to cut off the restraint, and on the third attempt Keys’ hands were cut in at least two places, causing him to bleed profusely. 
Only after another officer was called to bring over a cutter was the restraint removed successfully. Keys was taken to a hospital, where he received stitches in one finger and was treated for nerve damage to other fingers. Keys was released back into police custody, where he was charged with three misdemeanor crimes and three traffic offenses.

Another female resident left the gated area and exchanged words with the officers. The officers pursued her. Sims opened the locked gate when an officer told her to. The officers couldn’t catch the other resident and turned their attention to Sims. 
One officer told Sims to put away her cellphone. Another asked what Sims was drinking. A “taste of beer,” she answered. The officer threatened to arrest her for an open container. Sims responded that it was her property. The officers surrounded her. A male officer grabbed her hair, threw her down and kneed her in the back. 
Green saw the officer grab his wife and walked out of the building. He asked the officers why they were doing this to her. Two officers pointed Tasers at Green and told him to get his “fat ass“ back into the building. Green was jumped before he made it back inside. One officer put a knee into his back while another stood on his hand. Sims and Green were thrown into a wagon with the men who were arrested earlier.
