1. Which pairings between identity groups of officers and their respective accusers are most common? (One axis is officer identity group, the other axis is accuser identity group. Each intersection of officer and accuser is a datapoint of number of instances. Data points are larger with greater number of instances.)

QUERY:
> CREATE TABLE vis1_1 AS WITH pairing_allegations AS (SELECT c.race as complainant_race, o.race as officer_race, c.gender as complainant_gender, o.gender as officer_gender, oa.disciplined FROM data_allegation a, data_officerallegation oa, data_officer o, data_complainant c WHERE o.id = a.id AND o.id = oa.officer_id AND c.allegation_id = a.id) SELECT complainant_race, officer_race, complainant_gender, officer_gender, COUNT(*) FROM pairing_allegations WHERE complainant_race is NOT NULL AND officer_race is NOT NULL AND complainant_gender is NOT NULL AND officer_gender is NOT NULL GROUP BY complainant_race, officer_race, complainant_gender, officer_gender;
QUERY:
> \copy vis1_1 to '/Users/caseygrage/Downloads/vis1_1.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);

2. Which identity groups make an officer most likely to have an allegation? (Pie chart/bar graph)
QUERY:
> CREATE TABLE vis2_1 AS WITH pairing_allegations AS (SELECT c.race as complainant_race, o.race as officer_race, c.gender as complainant_gender, o.gender as officer_gender, oa.disciplined FROM data_allegation a, data_officerallegation oa, data_officer o, data_complainant c WHERE o.id = a.id AND o.id = oa.officer_id AND c.allegation_id = a.id) SELECT officer_race, officer_gender, COUNT(*) FROM pairing_allegations WHERE officer_race is NOT NULL AND officer_gender is NOT NULL GROUP BY officer_race, officer_gender;
> \copy vis2_1 to '/Users/caseygrage/Downloads/vis2_1.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);

I’ve only looked at COUNTS of different variables. But these counts are pretty meaningless without comparing identity groups to the overall police or civilian populations. 
So here is a spreadsheet of the officers with allegations (broken down by race/gender) as well as the totals of each race/gender from the police officer. 
QUERY:
> CREATE TABLE vis2_2 AS WITH officer_totals AS (SELECT COUNT (distinct o.id) as total_count, o.race as officer_race, o.gender as officer_gender FROM data_officer o WHERE o.race is NOT NULL GROUP BY o.race, o.gender) SELECT officer_race, officer_gender, COUNT(*) as alleg_count, 100*(COUNT(*)/total_count) as percentage FROM officer_totals WHERE officer_race is NOT NULL AND officer_gender is NOT NULL GROUP BY officer_race, officer_gender, total_count;

3. What identity groups of civilians make them more likely to file complaints/accusations for each type of harassment? (Pie chart/bar graph)
Need table of complainant_gender, complainant_race, and type of harassment...
QUERY:
> CREATE TABLE vis3_1 AS WITH pairing_allegations AS (SELECT c.race as complainant_race, c.gender as complainant_gender, ac.category as alleg_category FROM data_allegation a, data_officerallegation oa, data_officer o, data_complainant c, data_allegationcategory ac WHERE o.id = a.id AND o.id = oa.officer_id AND c.allegation_id = a.id AND oa.allegation_category_id = ac.id) SELECT complainant_race, complainant_gender, alleg_category, COUNT(*) FROM pairing_allegations WHERE complainant_race is NOT NULL AND complainant_gender is NOT NULL GROUP BY complainant_race, complainant_gender, alleg_category;
> \copy vis3_1 to '/Users/caseygrage/Downloads/vis3_1.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);


4. What identity groups of officers make them more likely to have complaints/accusations for each type of harassment filed against them? (highlight table)
Need table of officer_gender, officer_race, and type of harassment
QUERY:
> CREATE TABLE vis4_1 AS WITH pairing_allegations AS (SELECT o.race as officer_race, o.gender as officer_gender, ac.category as alleg_category FROM data_allegation a, data_officerallegation oa, data_officer o, data_complainant c, data_allegationcategory ac WHERE o.id = a.id AND o.id = oa.officer_id AND c.allegation_id = a.id AND oa.allegation_category_id = ac.id) SELECT officer_race, officer_gender, alleg_category, COUNT(*) FROM pairing_allegations WHERE officer_race is NOT NULL AND officer_gender is NOT NULL GROUP BY officer_race, officer_gender, alleg_category;
> \copy vis4_1 to '/Users/caseygrage/Downloads/vis4_1.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);

To account for gender and racial breakdown of actual police force compared to the number of allegations by gender of race:
Use this query to get totals of race and gender in police force: 
> SELECT COUNT (distinct o.id), o.race, o.gender FROM data_officer o WHERE o.race is NOT NULL GROUP BY o.race, o.gender;
All that data can be added to the previous vis4_1 table as  a column using a simple python statement (just wherever race = ___ and gender = ___, fill the ‘total’ column with the corresponding total from the above select statement. The percentage can be calculated by dividing the no. allegation column by the total count column and multiplying by 100.
