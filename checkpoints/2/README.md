# Checkpoint 2 - Data Cleaning and Integration

### Lessons Learned
*Below are the main takeaways and analysis from Checkpoint 2. Full procedures and output can be found in the Checkpoint #2 report.*

1. Are the identity groups most represented in plaintiffs from the settlement data also most likely to be victims in the complaint reports?

 There doesn’t seem to be a huge difference between complainant racial breakdown and plaintiff racial breakdown. The main notable change was that the percentage of black plaintiffs is higher than the percentage of black complainants, while the opposite is true of hispanics. It is possible that black civilians are more likely to file more serious allegations than other races. It is also possible that hispanics are less likely to follow up complaints with legal action. This could be due to obstacles against them (lawyers are less likely to take their cases, etc.).

 The majority of settlements happen in lower income neighborhoods. The racial breakdown of these neighborhoods’ populations is such that black plaintiffs are by far the most common in low income neighborhoods, while white plaintiffs are the most common in wealthier neighborhoods. The majority of hispanic plaintiffs have settlements that occur in middle to low income areas. It is also interesting to see that the only income area in which all four major races are represented is the lower middle class $40,000 - $50,000. This graph shows that plaintiffs are largely lower income, and largely black and hispanic. However, the number of plaintiffs steadies for the middle to upper classes.

2. Are certain identity groups overrepresented in the complaints and settlement database compared to the general population?

 From this initial exploration, we see that there is a wide range in the percentage of people in a certain identity group who file complaints. In particular, the rate of complaints from people who are black is almost triple that of those who are white, and 12x the rate of those who are Asian. This suggests that there may be underlying factors (cultural, societal, biases, etc.) that affect these rates.

3. Do police officers of certain identity groups have more allegations against them in low income areas than in higher income areas?

 In higher income neighborhoods, Black officers were more likely to have allegations against them compared to the overall population of black people while white officers were less likely to have allegations against them compared to the general population in that neighborhood. Interestingly, Asian officers were much less likely to have allegations against them compared to the overall population, but this could be due simply to the small sample size. In lower income neighborhoods, white officers were much more likely to have allegations against them compared to the general population while black officers were much less likely to have allegations against them compared to the general population. From this, we learned that income area matters a lot in correlating whether an officer of a certain race is more or less likely to have an allegation against them compared to the general population.

4. Are certain identity groups overrepresented as complainants in low income areas verses higher income areas compared to the general population?

 In high income neighborhoods, Black civilians were disproportionately more likely to file complaints against officers than their reflected populations in the area, in many cases on a scale of 5x to 10x higher than their percentage of the population. On the other hand, White civilians were disproportionately less likely to file complaints in proportion to their overall percentage of the population. This may suggest underlying differences in treatment by police officers towards civilians of different races. In lower income areas, this disparity is not as apparent. It is interesting to note that the demographic makeups of these areas are not as “white-dominant,” so it may be difficult to draw wide conclusions among lower-income areas. Despite this, in general, Black civilians remain the most likely group to file complaints against officers, suggesting a common pattern.
